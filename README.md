# Pack Your Umbrella
## Google Chrome extension with alarm pop-up

The extension asks for your localization and checks the weather forecast for the next morning in your area using openweatherapp.

You can open it whenever you want, but pop up runs at 21:30 every day or when the browser is starting - one can change fixed time in background.js
